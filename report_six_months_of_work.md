## Report: six months of work

### In defence of prejudice 
I had this judgemental view ever since I was a kid, it brought me arrogance, loneliness, and pain. As an attempt to mitigate this pain, I grew this habit to see merits in stupidity, grits in narrow-minded, to see humanity in the most desperate and benumbed souls. This mindset turned out to be a hindrance for me to excel at software engineering. See, with this moderate, sympathetic, always in the middle of the fence mindset, I simply don't have the stubbornness that software engineers need, how am I gonna write neat code when my first instinct to tackle a problem is ask [bRong Njam](https://github.com/aunjgr) for help. 
I thought communicating and receiving help is a good way to blend in, I didn't know as programmers, we communicate in source code.  

### It isn't hard to be a software engineer when you have a boring life
You don't need to fret that you code too much, it will stiffen your facial muscle, it already is. Your language skills atrophying, but you don't mind, it's been years the last time you fathom witty comebacks for conversations anyway. Earth is too comfortable a place to evolve pure logical creatures, and it's natural for us mere mortals to get bored and distracted when writing program. Took me years of rigorous training to cultivate a relentless logical reasoning brain, never liked it much, but it does give me the ability to write printf messages debugging codebase all day without getting bored. 
Just like most fresh graduates hustling in Shanghai, reality can be daunting and it's tempting to take the blue pill of tittytainments, programming would never be the same for me once I give in, their recommendation algorithms are evolving and I don't know how long before I give in.

### They say relational model is the only truth
I had a hard time appreciate the relational model, couldn't see the beauty in it. The wikipedia entry for relational calculus is like, only 100 words, no real subject can be this short, and the relational algebra wikipedia page seemed averting to me talking nothing but join. The first time I saw the query language SQL, I don't see the necessity in it, we have a whole language in set theory one hundred years ago. The fact that DBAs design tables using Peter Chen's entity-relational model then translate it into 3NF, the duplicated column needed for joining two tables, duplicate the entire row 'cause the entry has more than one value in an attribute, everything seemed dubious to me. 
I see the redundancy in IMS, the tangling mess in network model, but arranging data in tabular form just doesn't seem natural to me. 
Haha..., these are just ignorant rambling, what do I know, never wrote applications dealing with data before. 
They say "nosql" means "no, sql!", I trust them and I admire Ted Codd as a pilot.
